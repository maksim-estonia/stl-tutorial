_What is STL?_

STL stands for standard template library. It is a set of template classes that provides many basic algorithms or containers.

Components of STL:

- Containers
- Iterators
- Algorithms
- Function objects

_What are containers?_

A container can be defined as objects that are used to store data (elements) of similar types.

- Sequence containers
    - Vector
    - Deque
    - List
- Associative containers
    - Set
    - Multiset
    - Map
    - Multimap
- Container adapters
    - Stack
    - Queue

_What are iterators?_

Iterators are those entities that helps in traversing through elements.

It can be traversed from one element to the next element in the range by incrementing.

An iterator contains two functions:

- begin(): it returns iterator for the first element.
- end(): it returns the iterator to the last element.

_What are algorithms?_

Algorithms can be defined as procedures that are applied to the containers. It provides some operations for the content of the container.

- Modifying algorithms: add, reverse
- Non-modifying algorithms: count, equal, search
- Sorting algorithms: sort
- Searching algorithms: binary search
- Numeric algorithms: accumulate, partial sum

_What are function objects?_

A function object is an object of template class that implements the call operator.
